            Eddy (Nick Moran) convinces three friends to pool funds for a
            high-stakes poker game against local crime boss Hatchet Harry (P.H.
            Moriarty). Harry cheats and Eddy loses, giving him a week to pay
            back 500,000 pounds or hand over his father's pub. Desperate, Eddy
            and his friends wait for their neighbors to rob some drug dealers,
            then rob the robbers in turn. After both thefts, the number of
            interested criminal parties increases, with the four friends in
            dangerously over their heads.

            To be young and carefree amid the blue waters and idyllic landscape
            of sun-drenched Italy in the late 1950s; that's la dolce vita Tom
            Ripley (Matt Damon) craves- and Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) leads.

            extremes to which Ripley will go to make their lifestyle his own.

            This documentary focuses on drag queens living in New York City and
            their "house" culture, which provides a sense of community and
            support for the flamboyant and often socially shunned performers.
            Groups from each house compete in elaborate balls that take cues
            from the world of fashion. Also touching on issues of racism and
            poverty, the film features interviews with a number of renowned drag
            queens, including Willi Ninja, Pepper LaBeija and Dorian Corey.

            Defying the very notion of good taste, Scary Movie out-parodies the
            pop culture parodies with a no-holds barred assault on the most
            popular images and talked-about moments from recent films,
            television and commercials. The film boldly fires barbs at the
            classic scenes from "Scream," "The Sixth Sense," "The Matrix," "I
            Know What You Did Last Summer" and "The Blair Witch Project," then
            goes on to mock a whole myriad of teen movie clich√©s, no matter the
            genre.
